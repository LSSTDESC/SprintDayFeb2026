## Tips

Finding a sprint topic: If you are looking for sprint ideas to propose, some possible project themes include DP1 analyses, DP2/Science Verification planning, DESC pipeline construction/maintenance, and sprints that improve communication tools within DESC. Sprints are invitations to your DESC collaborators to come and work with you on your project! Not sure what to post? Check out the list of sprint & hack projects at recent sprint events:  [Sprint Week 2025](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SprintWeek2025), [UIUC 2025](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SprintDayUIUC2025), [Sprint Day Virtual 2025](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SprintDayFeb2025/), [ETH Zurich 2024](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SprintWeek2024/). 


Sprint readiness: If you are proposing a sprint, we encourage you to complete the [sprint readiness](https://lsstdesc.org/sprint-checklist/) checklist that will help you make sure you have a productive time with your sprint.
